### README# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack - though less focused on front-end, prioritizing back-end development learning - web application built with Node and Express.  It allows users to shorten URLs upon a quick registration, saving these short-urls to their personal accounts.  Though the urls can be shared, anyone using the urls who is not registered to the account can not delete nor edit them.  Feel like changing the url-path of the randomized url?  Using the built-in edit feature, you are able to change the end point of any of the urls you have generated, as many times as you'd like.
